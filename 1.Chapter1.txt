Mastering Security Basic

-MD5, SHA,  HMAC

-3 Meaning of MAC
    1.Media Access Control(MAC) - Assigned to (NIC Network Interface Card)

-Digital Signature: Prevent attackers from impersonating other and sending malicious emails.
-Redundacy: adds duplication to critical component has fault, the duplication provided by the Redundacy allows
the service to continue without interruption.
    *Disk Redundancies 
    *Server Redundancies
    *Load Balancing 
    *Site Redundancies
    *Backups
    *Alternating power
    *Cooling

-Technical Control  
    *Encryption
    *Antivirus Software
    *Intrusion detection system (IDS) Intrusion Prevention system (IPs)
    *Firewalls
    *Least Priviledge
    
-Administrative Control - use method  mandated by organization policies of other guidelines.
    *Risk Assessments
    *Vulnerability Assessments
    *Pentration Tests
    *Awareness and training
    *Configuration and change management
    *Contingency Planning
    *Media Protection
    *Physical and environment Protection
-Physical Controls - are any controls that you can physical touch.
-Control Goals - Technical and Administrative controls categorize the controls based on how they are implemented.
-Preventive Control - to prevent Security incidents
    *Hardening
    *Security Awareness and training
    *Security guards
    *Change management
    *Account disablement policy
-Dectetive Control - attempt to detech when Vulnerabilities have exploited, resulting in a Security incident.
    *Log Monitoring
    *Trend Analysis
    *Security Audit
    *Video Surveillance
    *Monitoring Detection
-Deterren Controls - Attempt to discourage a threat. Some deterrent controls attempt to discourage potential attackers.
    *Cable locks
    *Hardware locks
-Compensating Controls - are Alternative controls used instead of primary control.
    ex: Smart Key
-Virtualization - is a popular technology used within large data centers and can do be used a on regular personal computer
it allows you to host one more virtual system.
-Hypervisor - software that creates, run and manages the VMs is the hypervisor.
    -Ex products: VMware, MS hyper-V and Oracle VM Virtual box
-Host - the physical system hosting the VMs is the hypervisor several Virtualization technologies currently exist, including    
VMware products.
-Guest - operating systems running on the host system are guest or guest machine.
-Host Elasticity  and Scalability - Elasticity and Scalability refer to the ability to resize computing capacity basd on the load.

-Company Hypervisors
    *Type 1 - run directly on the system hardware. They often called baremetal Hypervisor because they dont need run within
                operating system.
    *Type 2 - run a software within a host operaing system.

Note: Kernel is the central part uses of the operating system.

-Container Virtualization - as part run within isolated cells or container and does not have its own kernel.

-Snapshots - provides you with a copy of the VM at the moment in time, which you can use a backup.

-VDI/VDE and non Persistence - a user's desktop operaing system runs as a VM on a Server.
    Benefits: users PC can have limited hardware.

-VM as a file - is just a group of files, it becomes relatively easy to move them from one physical server to another.

-Risk Associated with Virtualization
    *VM Escape - is an attack that allows a attackers to access the host system from within the virtual system.
    *VM Sprawl - occurs when an organization has many VM's that aren't mamanged properly

-Using Command
    -Line Tools
    -Windows Command Line
    -Linux Terminal

Ping -is a basic command used to test connectivity for remote systems.
    You can also use it to verify a system can resolve valid host names
    to IP addresses, test the NIC, and check the security posture of a Network.
    Example: 
        ping 192.168.1.1
        ping -t 192.168.1.1
        ping -c 4 192.168.1.1
        ping getcertifiedgetahead.com

-Firewalls
    
REMEMBER THIS: Administrator use ping to check connectivity of remote systems and verift name resolution is working.
                They also use ping to check the security posture of systems and networks by verifying that routers, firewall and IS BLOCK

-Ipconfig(short for internet protocol Configuration) - shows the transmission control protocol/internet protocol(TCP/IP) configuration information for a system.

-Ifconfig(short for interface configuration) - Linux-based

-ipconfig - provides basic information about the the NIC, such as the IP address, subnet mask and the default gateway.
-ipconfig/all - this commnand shows comprehensive listing of TCP/IP configuration information for each NIC
Ipconfig/displaydns - each time a system queries DNS to resolve a host name to an IP address.
ipconfig/flushdns - you can erase the contents of the DNS cache with this command.
Ifconfig etho - shows the configurationof the first ethernet interface(NIC) on Linux.
Ifconfig etho promise - enales promiscuous mode on the first ethernet interface.
Ifconfig etho allmulti - this command enables mutilcast mode on the NIC. This allows the NIC to process allmulti
                        multicast traffic received by the NIC.

REMEMBER THIS - Windows system use ipconfig to view networks interface. Linux systems use Ifconfig can also manipulate the settings on the network interfaces.
